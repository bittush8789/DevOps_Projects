So Talking about my day to day activities, as i explained you before, i work for two Development teams where i closely attend their meetings and i work with them in agile methodology, where these development teams plan activities during the sprints or they plan activities for the entire quarter, and i closely with them during that meetings, so that i understand the roadmap of those development teams for the coming quarter. 

And with that, i can also estimate the amount of work that is going to come to me, and i would plan my activities accordingly. 
let me explain some of the tasks that i get from those teams. 

For example , the team requests me to create come infrastructure because i am the one who developed and manage infrasture as code for those development teams.
one of the recent activity i worked on was setup EKS cluster within VPC, and i set that up  in the module structure so that going ahead, either other DevOps teams or some who join my  teams or someone who is going to work alone with me, cam also use those Terraform modules.

Along with that, i get a lot of requests related to k8s deployments. 
I have requests to set up Gitops practices for the Development teams, or it can be even activities related to  AWS. 
And there are some frequent activities like git management where we have multiple get repository so i setup webhook for that, i manage the git repo with respect to branching.

I make sure that branching strategy is up to date.
So These are some of the day to day activities that i work on.


=======================================================================================================

i help the developers to containerize their microservices. So of the developers are very new. There are junior 
Developers, so i also help them writing Docker files. 
As a DevOps Engineer, i also document the best practices for, How to containerize with best practices like Distroless images. and i share this documentation across the team which does not have DevOps engineer. they can follow the documents. 

Based on job description i have to add those skills in my day to day tasks....
