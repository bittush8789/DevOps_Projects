As I explained you before, I work for multiple development teams and one of the issues that was open there, different microservices had different CI CD practices.
This was because there was no DevOps engineer before I joined, and developers were basically writing CI CD to the best of their knowledge and that created a lot of gap. Some of the ci CD was incomplete. Some of the services lacked a proper CI. Some of the services were not being deployed onto the clusters.
So once I joined, I learned about all the microservices, how they are deployed currently, how CI is implemented currently, and I have taken the initiative to implement a robust CI CD process where I have used GitHub actions for CI, and I have used Argo CD for CD to convince the management and to convince the development team.
I have taken two weeks of time to go through a microservice, which was a very critical microservice, and I implemented GitHub actions, CI and CD using Argo CD to demonstrate zero touch ci CD.
This was very well appreciated because it was a very big challenge to the development teams and the management.
Later, we took 3 to 4 months to propagate this to all the microservices.
At this point, all of the microservices are implemented using GitHub actions as well as Argo CD.
So this is one of the challenge that I faced. And I was really happy to solve this problem for my development teams.
