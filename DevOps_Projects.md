 Hi, my name is Bittu. I have 1.6 years of experience. I am currently working in EXl organization where the organization has a e-commerce application and this e-commerce application is a multi microservice architecture because there are more than 100 microservices. There are multiple development teams and each development team is responsible for certain microservices. As a DevOps engineer. My role is to work closely with two development teams. So my project is basically to work for both of those development teams and implement DevOps or constantly improve the DevOps practices for those development teams. And as part of that, I work on CI, CD for that project. I work on writing Terraform or Infrastructure as code for them, or I work on Kubernetes implementation. Constantly improving the existing scripts. So this is my project where I work for the development teams.


 I am responsible for DevOps implementation of those microservices and if they ask you more about your

organization, you can talk about like the flow of the organization.

You can explain how many development teams they have.

You can say that, you know the organization is e-commerce application.

For example, in this case, which sells astronomy, or you can say which sells clothing, which sells

pharma, anything that you like, right.

Or anything that you have prepared for.

So this is how you have to explain.
