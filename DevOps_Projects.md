 Hi, my name is Bittu. I have 1.6 years of experience. I am currently working in EXl organization where the organization has a e-commerce application and this e-commerce application is a multi microservice architecture because there are more than 100 microservices. There are multiple development teams and each development team is responsible for certain microservices. As a DevOps engineer. My role is to work closely with two development teams. So my project is basically to work for both of those development teams and implement DevOps or constantly improve the DevOps practices for those development teams. And as part of that, I work on CI, CD for that project. I work on writing Terraform or Infrastructure as code for them, or I work on Kubernetes implementation. Constantly improving the existing scripts. So this is my project where I work for the development teams.
